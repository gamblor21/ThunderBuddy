# ThunderBuddy

This small circuitboard uses an AS3935 chip to detect lightning at distances up to 40km away. By default it supports SPI but can be configured for I2C as well.

The board measures around 2cm a side with a small lightning shaped antenna area on top.

The board can be driven in CircuitPython with the [AS3935 driver](https://github.com/gamblor21/CircuitPython_AS3935).

For an example project using the board please see my [Lightning Detector](https://github.com/gamblor21/Lightning-Detector) project.
